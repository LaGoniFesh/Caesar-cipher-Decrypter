You find this cipher in a hidden message inside a phishing email:

Ymnx nx f xjsyjshj dtz yfxp hnumjw tk ymj wznhp.

What does it say? (Hint: Itâ€™s a simple Caesar cipher.)

For opesec purposes you can use this so programs such as prism and more adanvanced programs
dont detect specific words. Yes you could use pgp but this is just a diferent way of course.
